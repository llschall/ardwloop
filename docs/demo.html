<h2>Start the Java program</h2>

<h1>How the code internally works</h1>
<p>
    The demo code is written in Java and located in <i>app/src/main/java</i>.
    It applies the MVC pattern.
    It firstly intends to provide call examples to the <b>ardwloop API</b>.
</p>
<h2>DemoProgram</h2>
<ul>
    <li>public SetupData <b>ardwSetup</b>(SetupData setup)</li>
    <li>public LoopData <b>ardwLoop</b>(LoopData loop)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    It implements the <b>IArdwProgram</b> interface, by particular the 2 core methods:
    Any program using ardwloop should implement the <b>IArdwProgram</b> interface.
    That's the most important class to understand what the Demo program sends and receives from the Arduino board.
    <i>ardwloop.demo.model.<b>DemoProgram</b></i> implements the communication with the Arduino board.
</p>
<h2>DemoModel</h2>
<p>
    <i>ardwloop.demo.model.<b>DemoModel</b></i> is the model from the MVC pattern.
    The most important is that it starts the Ardwloop threads in its
    <b>start()</b> method, and that it forwards the necessary commands to its <b>DemoProgram</b> instance.
    In addition, it does the <i><u>optional</u></i> stuff hereafter:
    - it stores the <b>ArdwloopModel</b> that would enable to extract various information later on.
    - it uses the ardwloop <b>refresher</b> to synchronize the DemoView refresh with the Arduino communication cycles
</p>
<h2>StartDemo</h2>
<p>
    <i>ardwloop.demo.<b>StartDemo.main()</b></i> is where the program is started.
</p>
