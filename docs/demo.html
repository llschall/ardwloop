<h1>Run the demo</h1>

<h1>How the code internally works</h1>

The demo is written in Java and located in app/src/main/java.
It applies the MCV pattern.
It firstly intends to provide call examples to the ardwloop API.

<h2>DemoProgram</h2>

ardwloop.demo.model.DemoProgram implements the communication with the Arduino board.

That's the most important class to understand what the Demo program in Java sends and receives from the Arduino board.

It implements the IArdwProgram interface, by particular the 2 core methods:
- public SetupData ardwSetup(SetupData setup)
- public LoopData ardwLoop(LoopData loop)

Any program using ardwloop should implement the IArdwProgram interface.

<h2>DemoModel</h2>

ardwloop.demo.model.DemoModel is the model from the MVC pattern.

The most important is that it starts the Ardwloop threads in its start() method, and that it forwards the necessary commands to its DemoProgram instance.

In addition, it does the optional stuff hereafter:
- it stores the ArdwloopModel that would enable to extract various information later on.
- it uses the ardwloop refresher to synchronize the DemoView refresh with the Arduino communication cycles

<h2>StartDemo</h2>

ardwloop.demo.StartDemo.main() is where the program is started.
