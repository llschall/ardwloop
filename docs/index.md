# Welcome to the ardwloop page !

Ardwloop is an open source Java framework designed to ease the control of an Arduino program from a Java
program.
From both sides the Java and the Arduino programs would typically need to firstly handshake each other and then
exchange data on a regular basis.

The source code is available in the ![Github repository](https://github.com/llschall/ardwloop).
