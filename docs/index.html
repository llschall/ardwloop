<h1>Welcome to the ardwloop page !</h1>

<section>Ardwloop is an open source Java framework designed to ease the control of an Arduino program from a Java
    program.
    From both sides the Java and the Arduino programs would typically need to firstly handshake each other and then
    exchange data on a regular basis.

    The source code is available in <a href="https://github.com/llschall/ardwloop">Github</a>.
