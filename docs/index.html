<h1>Welcome to the ardwloop page !</h1>

<p>Ardwloop is an open source Java framework easing the control of an Arduino program from a Java
    program.<br>
    From both sides the Java and the Arduino programs would typically need to firstly handshake each other and then
    exchange data on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The entire source code is available in the <a href="https://github.com/llschall/ardwloop">Github repository</a>.</p>
